# Snake: Overcomplicated Ediiton
So I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnN6eBamwj4) and some of the ideas were quite interesting, so I stole the idea and made an actual game based off of it with overcomplicated features from other popular games, turning something so basic into a feature complete game!

## Features
- Snake system with score
- Upgrades
- Reactive interfaces
